# rusz-glowa-java
This is an experimental GIT repository, where I try to learn how to work from GIT Bash commandline and post my JAVA codes.
This will be up to date an will be everchanging.
Most of my codes will be stated in branches, for easier navigation and to make semi-healthy habit of working with branching in GIT Bash.
